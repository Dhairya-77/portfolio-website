        <p>
            I am Dhairya Bhoya, an aspiring software developer currently pursuing my 
            Master of Computer Applications (MCA) from Charotar University of Science and Technology.
            I graduated with a B.Sc. in Information Technology with a 9.45 CGPA. I am passionate about mobile and web app development, 
            with experience in building Android apps using Kotlin and Flutter, as well as full-stack web apps using the MEAN stack.
